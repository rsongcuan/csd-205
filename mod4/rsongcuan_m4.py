big10schools = ('illinois', 'indiana', 'iowa', 'maryland', 'minnesota', 'michigan', 'michigan state', 'minnesota', 'nebraska', 'northwestern', 'ohio state', 'penn state', 'purdue', 'rutgers', 'wisconsin')

#2: Display the contents in a single statement
print(big10schools)

#3: Iterate through the collection displaying the output as a complete sentence using each value
for university in big10schools:
	print(f"\n{university.title()} is a member of the Big Ten Conference.")

#4: Repeat the output in reverse order using a different context string
backwords = reversed(big10schools)
